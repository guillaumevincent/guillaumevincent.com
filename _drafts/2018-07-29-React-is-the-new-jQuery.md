Since the first July 2018, AngularJS entered in a 3 year Long Term Support period. Angular team will focus exclusively on providing fixes to bugs. No new feature.

AngularJS popularity started around september 2012. And the pic of popularity was in Jul 2015. 3 years. If you choose React today, who does not tell you in 3 years you will not have to change? Nobody can predict the future. So rather than being frightened by a framework change in the future, let's think about how to make migration easier if we decide to change.

## Avoid full stack framework

The beauty of AngularJS was the dependencie injection. It made the tests easier. Little by little we were transforming our application into a module, then in components (`angular.component`).
